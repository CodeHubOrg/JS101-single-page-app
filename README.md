### Mini Single Page Application for CodeHub 

The start of an SPA, using just vanilla JavaScript. Waiting to be refactored!

This app is based on the following tutorial, but is not using jQuery or Handlebars. [http://tutorialzine.com/2015/02/single-page-app-without-a-framework/](http://tutorialzine.com/2015/02/single-page-app-without-a-framework/)

(There is currently one PHP script that you can run to concatenate the JSON profile files)
